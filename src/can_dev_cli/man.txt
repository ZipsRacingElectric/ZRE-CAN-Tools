Methods:
Transmiting Frames:
    t=<ID>[<Byte 1>,<Byte 2>,...<Byte n>]
        Transmits a single CAN frame.

    t=<ID>[<Byte 1>,<Byte 2>,...<Byte n>]@<Freq>,<Count>
        Transmits a CAN frame at a specified frequency.

    Arguments:
        ID     - The CAN ID of the frame to transmit.
        Byte n - The n'th byte of the payload, in little-endian.
        Freq   - The frequency to transmit at, in Hertz.
        Count  - The number of times to transmit the message.

Receiving Frames:
    r - Receives the first available CAN message.

    r=[<ID 0>,<ID 1>,...<ID n>]
        Receives the first available CAN message from a list of IDs.

    r=[<ID 0>,<ID 1>,...<ID n>]@<Count>
        Receives the first set of availble CAN messages from a list of IDs.

    r=[]@<Iterations>
        Receives the first set of available CAN messages.

    d - Dumps all received CAN messages.

    d=[<ID 0>,<ID 1>,...<ID n>]
        Dumps all received CAN messages from a list of IDs.

    Arguments:
        ID n  - The n'th CAN ID to filter for.
        Count - Specifies the number CAN frames to receive
